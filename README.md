# Assignment 3
#### An application that multiplies numbers using bit shifting, 27/10/2020
#### By **Jeremy Kimotho**
## Description
The application first generates a random integer between 0 and 15. A loop is then run to multiply the random integer and a value between -15 and 15 using bit shifting. We take the and of the multiplier, then add the multiplicand to the sum. Afterwards, we'll logically shift the multiplier left and arithmetically shift the multplicand right. The counter is incremented and we repeat this process 63 times.
